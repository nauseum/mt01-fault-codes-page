Hey everyone,
I used Google Gemini to parse the bike manual and create a web app to lookup fault codes for the MT-01. This was done as a curiosity mostly, but it did a pretty damn good job!
The goal was to make our lives a little easier when that dreaded engine light pops up. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages of a PDF, you can now quickly get the info you need.
Here’s what it does:

🔍 Instant Fault Code Search: Just type in the fault code (e.g., 12, 42, Er-1) and get the details immediately.

📋 Full Fault Index: If you just want to browse, the main page lists all the fault codes and their symptoms. Just click on one to see the details.

🔧 Detailed Troubleshooting: It doesn't just tell you the problem; it gives you the list of probable causes and the step-by-step diagnostic checks straight from the service manual.

🛠️ Diagnostic Mode Guide: There’s also a "Diagnostic Mode" button that opens a pop-up with the full instructions on how to get your bike into the diagnostic mode, including images from the manual showing which buttons to press.

Hope you all find it useful! Ride safe.
