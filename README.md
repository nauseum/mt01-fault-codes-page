Hey everyone,

The goal was to make our fellow MT-01 Riders lives a little easier when that nondescript error code pops up. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages of a PDF, you can now quickly get the info you need.

Here’s what it does:

🔍 Instant Fault Code Search: Just type in the fault code (e.g., 12, 42, Er-1) or any text, and get smart hit count based results for the details immediately.

📋 Full Fault Index: If you just want to browse, the main page lists all the fault codes and their symptoms. Just click on one to see the details.

🔧 Detailed Troubleshooting: It doesn't just tell you the problem; it gives you the list of probable causes and the step-by-step diagnostic checks straight from the service manual.

🛠️ Diagnostic Mode Guide: There’s also a "Diagnostic Mode" button that opens a pop-up with the full instructions on how to get your bike into the diagnostic mode, including images from the manual showing which buttons to press.

🔍 Prompted Goold e search: Search google for the specific error with a ready made search string, just click through.
